# Description: Arduino IDE programs for the ESP8266. The server program sets up a server for the clients to communicate to and the client programs send messages to the server.
#              Client connects to proximity sensor and sends a message to the server when it detects an object in the desired range. The server receives messages sent from all
#              clients and sets its pin values according to this data.
